# Portfolio
My portfolio.

This portfolio was coded using HTML and CSS and is in four main sections.  

The first secion contains the main header featuring my name and quick links to the other three sections.

Beneath the main header is a brief self introduction and a picture of myself to help put a face to the name.  My apologies for that.

The headers for the remaining sections are purely titular to help avoid becoming lost in my expansive webpage.

The second section contains more information regarding my educational background.  As in where I studied, not my background as an educator.  Wait, that's in there too.  You know what, it makes more sense if you read it.

The third section features four projects I either coded myself or collaborated on with classmates.  I'm very proud of them, so I put them in probably-overstylized boxes to convey that pride.  Plus the boxes do that little shadow thingy when you hover over them.  Good stuff.

The final section contains links to my contact information.  If I haven't scared you off with the portfolio thus far, this gives me one last chance to do so.

The entire portfolio is capped with a footer (socked? I don't know what else you'd call a cap for your feet).  Clicking my name takes you right back to the top where that horrid picture has been patiently waiting.
