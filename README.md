# Portfolio
A basic portfolio.

I had originally intended to have the sections displayed as asides with my information beside them, but I grew attached to the horizontal format they're in now.  The color palette is a nod to my alma mater, East Carolina University.  The large black box at the top will eventually contain an image and shrink. Probably.
