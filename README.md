# Portfolio
My portfolio.

The huge black box has been reduced to a reasonable size and now contains a not-horrifying picture of me.

The My Work section now features links to Project 1, the JavaScript Homework, and the WebApi Homework and their repos.  It also features a screenshot of each application styled as a background for their respective cards.

The Contacts section now has links to my GitHub profile and my Indeed resume.
